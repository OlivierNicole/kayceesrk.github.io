I am a post-doctoral research associate under the [OCaml
Labs](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/) initiative at the
[University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/) [Computer
Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/). I am also a member of the [Network and
Operating Systems](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/) group.

I am interested in the design and implementation of concurrent functional
programming languages targeting scalable platforms such as many-core processors
and compute clouds. My research spans programming models, compilers, static
analysis, schedulers, threading systems, and memory management.

Before coming to Cambridge, I was a graduate student at [Purdue
University](http://www.purdue.edu/) where I obtained an MS and PhD degrees in
Computer Science under the supervision of the wonderful [Prof. Suresh
Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). At Purdue, I led the
[MultiMLton](http://multimlton.cs.purdue.edu/) and
[Quelea](http://kcsrk.info/Quelea/) projects. Before that, I obtained my BEng
degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Anna University,
India](https://www.annauniv.edu/).
